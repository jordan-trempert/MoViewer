        <h1>Privacy Policy for MoViewer</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 9/7/2024</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to <strong>MoViewer</strong>, developed by <strong>Stardom Studios</strong>. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting any personal information you may provide while using our app. This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>MoViewer</strong> handles your data, including the use of third-party services such as Firebase Authentication, as well as how we store and manage user comments and movie ratings.</p>

        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p><strong>MoViewer</strong> uses Firebase Authentication for login services, including Google sign-in. When you log in with Google, we collect certain personal information provided by Google, such as your name, email address, and profile picture. This information is used solely for authentication and identifying users for features such as commenting and rating movies.</p>

        <p>Additionally, when you interact with <strong>MoViewer</strong> by rating or commenting on movies, we collect and store the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Comments:</strong> Any comments you submit on movies.</li>
            <li><strong>Ratings:</strong> Your movie ratings (e.g., 1â€“5 stars).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is stored to enhance your experience and allow you to manage your ratings and comments across multiple sessions.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We use Firebase, a service provided by Google, to handle authentication and data storage. Firebase may collect and process certain data as described in their <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">privacy policy</a>. By using features like Google sign-in, you agree to the handling of your information in accordance with Firebase's policies.</p>

        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>Authentication data and all user-generated content such as comments and movie ratings are securely stored using Firebase's cloud services. We do not share your data with any third parties beyond Firebase's secure infrastructure. Other personal data related to your use of <strong>MoViewer</strong>, such as your preferences and settings, may also be stored locally on your device.</p>

        <h2>Use of Data</h2>
        <p>The data we collect (such as your comments and ratings) is used for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Displaying your ratings and comments within the app.</li>
            <li>Allowing you to manage and edit your ratings and comments.</li>
            <li>Improving the overall user experience on <strong>MoViewer</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain your authentication data, comments, and ratings for as long as you continue using the app. You may choose to delete your account or any individual comments and ratings at any time. If you log out or discontinue using the app, your data will remain stored securely until you choose to delete it or upon request.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We take your privacy and data security seriously. Firebase Authentication provides secure login mechanisms, and we follow best practices to protect your data. However, it is your responsibility to ensure that your device is secure. We recommend using device security measures such as passcodes or encryption to protect your personal information.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>From time to time, we may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. If we make any changes, the updated Privacy Policy will be available on this page, and the "Last updated" date will be revised accordingly.</p>
